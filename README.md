## Milestone Project 1

I chose to update the website for my father's plumbing shop as my first Milestone Project. The current site is very outdated and needed a good bit of updating, it's very busy and isn't user friendly.
I wanted to make the site more simple and easy to use. I also felt like it was a good way for me to build my confidence back up, having failed my college degree.

## Home Page

The Home Page of the website is very minimal, it just has the navigation for the site in the header, the hero image, any special offers, and a footer containing the contact details and the map.

Above is a screenshot of the navigation and hero image. The image was taken directly from the original website which is currently being used and linked below.
The navigation is based on what we learned in the course.
The main colour scheme which you can see in the header is based on the shops logo below.

### Special offer
For the special offer I just did a simple card for display the basic information. When you click on the card it opens up a modal to display the full information.
