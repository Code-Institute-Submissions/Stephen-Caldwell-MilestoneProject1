## Milestone Project 1

I chose to update the website for my father's plumbing shop as my first Milestone Project. The current site is very outdated and needed a good bit of updating, it's very busy and isn't user friendly.
I wanted to make the site more simple and easy to use. I also felt like it was a good way for me to build my confidence back up, having failed my college degree.

## Home Page

The Home Page of the website is very minimal, it just has the navigation for the site in the header, the hero image, any special offers, and a footer containing the contact details and the map.
